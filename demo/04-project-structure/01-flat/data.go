		{
			Name:    "Pliny the Elder",
			Brewery: "Russian River Brewing Company",
			Abv:     8,
			ShortDesc: "Pliny the Elder is brewed with Amarillo, " +
				"Centennial, CTZ, and Simcoe hops. It is well-balanced with " +
				"malt, hops, and alcohol, slightly bitter with a fresh hop " +
				"aroma of floral, citrus, and pine.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Oatmeal Stout",
			Brewery: "Samuel Smith",
			Abv:     5,
			ShortDesc: "Brewed with well water (the original well at the " +
				"Old Brewery, sunk in 1758, is still in use, with the hard well " +
				"water being drawn from 85 feet underground); fermented in " +
				"‘stone Yorkshire squares’ to create an almost opaque, " +
				"wonderfully silky and smooth textured ale with a complex " +
				"medium dry palate and bittersweet finish.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Märzen",
			Brewery: "Schlenkerla",
			Abv:     5,
			ShortDesc: "Bamberg's speciality, a dark, bottom fermented " +
				"smokebeer, brewed with Original Schlenkerla Smokemalt from " +
				"the Schlenkerla maltings and tapped according to old tradition " +
				"directly from the gravity-fed oakwood cask in the historical " +
				"brewery tavern.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Duvel",
			Brewery: "Duvel Moortgat",
			Abv:     9,
			ShortDesc: "A Duvel is still seen as the reference among strong " +
				"golden ales. Its bouquet is lively and tickles the nose with an " +
				"element of citrus which even tends towards grapefruit thanks to " +
				"the use of only the highest-quality hop varieties.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Negra",
			Brewery: "Modelo",
			Abv:     5,
			ShortDesc: "Brewed longer to enhance the flavors, this Munich " +
				"Dunkel-style Lager gives way to a rich flavor and remarkably " +
				"smooth taste.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Guinness Draught",
			Brewery: "Guinness Ltd.",
			Abv:     4,
			ShortDesc: "Pours dark brown, almost black with solid lasting light brown head. " +
				"Aroma of bitter cocoa, light coffee and roasted malt. " +
				"Body is light sweet, medium bitter. " +
				"Body is light to medium, texture almost thin and carbonation average. " +
				"Finish is medium bitter cocoa with more pronounced roast flavor. Smooth drinker.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "XX Lager",
			Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
			Abv:     4.2,
			ShortDesc: "A crisp, refreshing, light-bodied malt-flavored beer with a well-balanced finish. " +
				"A Lager that drinks like a Pilsner. A liquid embodiment of living life to the fullest. " +
				"A beverage made from pure spring water and the choicest hops. A beer with such good taste, it’s chosen you to drink it.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Tecate",
			Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
			Abv:     5,
			ShortDesc: "Very smooth, medium bodied brew. Malt sweetness is thin, and can be likened to diluted sugar water. " +
				"Touch of fructose-like sweetness. Light citric hop flavours gently prick the palate with tea-like notes that follow and fade quickly. " +
				"Finishes a bit dry with husk tannins and a pasty mouthfeel.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Sol",
			Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
			Abv:     5,
			ShortDesc: "While Corona wins the marketing wars in the U.S., Sol is the winning brand in much of Mexico, despite not being a standout in any respect. " +
				"You see the logo plastered everywhere and it’s seemingly on every restaurant and bar menu. Like Corona, it’s simple and inoffensive, " +
				"but still slightly more flavorful than your typical American macrobrew. At its best ice cold, and progressively worse as it gets warmer.",
		},
		{
			Name:    "Corona",
			Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
			Abv:     5,
			ShortDesc: "One of the five best-selling beers in the world, but it usually tastes better in Mexico, " +
				"where the bottles don’t have so much time in transit and on shelves. (Sunlight coming through clear bottles is never a good thing for beer.) " +
				"This is the typical “drink all afternoon” beer, working well on its own or with a plate of tacos. Refreshing with a lime.",
		},
